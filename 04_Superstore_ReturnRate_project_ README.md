# TripleTen Sprint 4 Project - Superstore Returns (Pt 2)

This is the 4th project I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. It was a great opportunity to dive deeper into the Superstore dataset, this time with a new focus on analyzing store returns. I expanded my Tableau skillset to include interactive dashboards and Tableau Story presentations.

### Superstore Returns (Pt 2)

The goal of this project is to help the CEO of the Superstore understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders. A presentation was also prepared, as well as a dashboard for monitoring returns.

#### The Data

The same two datasets from Project 3 were also used for this analysis:

`Orders`: Each row corresponds to a unique order placed at the Superstore
- `Row ID` 
- `Order ID` 
- `Order Date` 
- `Ship Mode` 
- `Customer ID`   
- `Customer Name` 
- `Segment` 
- `Country / Region` 
- `City` 
- `State` 
- `Postal Code` 
- `Region`
- `Product ID` 
- `Category` 
- `Sub-Category` 
- `Product Name` 
- `Sales` 
- `Quantity` 
- `Discount` 
- `Profit` 


`Returns`: Each row corresponds to unique order that was returned to the Superstore.
- `Returned` 
- `Order ID` 

The data is provided by TripleTen, who got it from Tableau.

#### The Process

First, I joined the data in Tableau on unique Order ID, as in Project 3. Then I prepared and pre-processed data for aggregations and use in key metrics. Then the analysis was conducted, using visualizations to identify correlations and measure metrics by a number of relevant dimensions. A dashboard was created for further monitoring of returns. Finally, the results of the analysis were summarized and presented in Tableau Story.


### Results 

The results of this analysis included a dashboard for monitoring returns by different measures and dimensions, as well as a presentation summarizing key findings of the analysis and proposed next steps.
